This was built during the 2016 MidWest Big-Data Hackathon at the University of Iowa

## Interface
The project is no longer hosted anywhere, but when it was, it was a sight to be seen... Entering the handle for any given Twitter user would download all of their Tweets and determine the user's sentiment towards Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton. You can see below how Donald Trump felt about himself.

## Location Data
We were also able to pull location data from geo-enabled Tweets. Here's where the Tweets were coming from during the third presidential debate of 2016.
